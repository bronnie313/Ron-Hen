            <h3> Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life: </h3>
            <ul id="list">
              <li><p>1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa</p></li>
              <li><p>11933 - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks</br>to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"<p></li>
              <li><p>11935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian</br> Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed</br> them", he said. </br>"All of this left scars on me.</p></li>
              <li><p>11937 - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</p></li>
              <li><p>11938 - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget</br> cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under</br> Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</p></li>
              <li><p>11941 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is</br> rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT</br> to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science</p></li>
              <li><p>11942 - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</p></li>
              <li><p>11944 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his</br> pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.</br> Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease</br> resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth</p></li>
              <li><p>11945 - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</p></li>
              <li><p>11953 - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling</br> American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to</br> provide 95% of Mexico's wheat</p></li>
              <li><p>11962 - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian</br> subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly</br> expanding population</p></li>
              <li><p>11970 - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</p></li>
              <li><p>11983 - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum</br> yields</p></li>
              <li><p>11984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</p></li>
              <li><p>12005 - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues</br> that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as</br> we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long</br> time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</p></li>
              <li><p>12009 - dies at the age of 95</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution</br> that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make </br>to human peace and progress."</br></br>

              -- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</p>
